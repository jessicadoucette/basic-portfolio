<h1>Basic Portfolio Assignment</h1>

This is my bio for the first homework assignment. I used flex box for the nav, wrapper, and footer. I used float for the bio image. 

<h2>index.html</h2>
This page hosts my bio along with my bio image. I used float on the image. 

<h2>portfolio.html</h2>
These are actual events i've worked on at the IT Reseller I work for. I used flex box to align the images. And positioning to place the text and background over the image. 

<h2>contact.html</h2>
I used html for creating the form. I used css to style the button.
